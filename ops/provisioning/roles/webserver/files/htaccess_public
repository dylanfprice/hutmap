## The next code line is currently commented out on purpose so it will be ignored.
## It is only for testing the code when you don't really want to close the site.
## It closes the site ONLY to you, but leaves it OPEN to everybody else.
## When commented out, the site is closed to everyone, including yourself.
## To enable the line, remove the # (pound sign) at the start of it.
## You MUST first change the digits 111 222 333 444 to match YOUR IP address.
#RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^75\.172\.53\.96$
## It is easy to modify the above line so it does the opposite:
## close the site to everybody else, but leave it OPEN to only you.
## Put an exclamation point ! in front of the ^ character, to make it: !^
#
## The remaining two code lines close the site. They say:
## If the request is NOT for /maintenance.php, send /maintenance.php instead.
## Allowing maintenance.php to be served as-is prevents an endless redirect loop.
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/maintenance\.php$
## To allow another file, copy the line above to here and change the filename.
#
## This line says: no matter what file was requested, serve maintenance.php.
## This is a rewrite (not a redirect), so we use the local file path, no http://
#RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /maintenance.php [L]
